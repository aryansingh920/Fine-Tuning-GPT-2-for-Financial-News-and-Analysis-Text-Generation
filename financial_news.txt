Summary: Zacks Investment Management Client Portfolio Manager Brian Mulberry shared his economic outlook following the latest PCE data release. "What we're really seeing is kind of just some stable data that doesn't reflect anything super bad but nothing super good either," he told Yahoo Finance. Mulberry notes this makes it difficult to justify the S&P 500's current valuation levels. Looking ahead to 2025's expected pro-growth agenda under Trump, Mulberry cautions investors about market transitions. "Simply what we're saying is we're at a moment of inflection as we change administrations and different policies come into play. You're really going to want to know what you own and know why you own it." For investment strategy, Mulberry recommends focusing on sectors with "real durable earnings structures" like financials and utilities, which he believes offer better growth potential and stability compared to the broader market.

Title: What the company behind Taser expects under Trump's second term
Summary: Axon (AXON), alongside Palantir (PLTR) and MicroStrategy (MSTR), is set to join the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). The company, which makes Tasers, police body cams, dash cams, and more, has been one of the best performers in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) since President-elect Donald Trump's reelection. Axon president Josh Isner joins Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to talk about its Nasdaq inclusion and what's to come for the defense company. Isner says the company's stock being added to the Nasdaq 100 is "a great milestone for the company" and "a great sign of external validation," but underlines the company's missions to "deploy tools into public safety that lead to safer outcomes between police and civilians." He adds, "We're here to serve the United States government however we can." The company could benefit from Trump's reelection since the administration has been "very vocal about the fact that the police need to be refunded, that they're going to be investing in a more secure border." Watch the video above to hear more from Isner about Axon. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend here.

Title: Could Lockheed, Northrop, and RTX gain from US drone sightings?
Summary: Amid reports of drone sightings in the Northeastern US, the reported drones have garnered the attention of many, including President-elect Donald Trump. Bloomberg Intelligence senior aerospace defense and airlines industry analyst George Ferguson joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the reports and examine how drones could impact defense companies. "I think it's nothing sort of too far out of the ordinary," Ferguson says, noting that some drone activity, both recreational and "a bit of surveillance," is typical. As drones make headlines, investors may wonder whether the tech could benefit aerospace and defense companies. The analyst says it will likely be smaller private tech companies and "some of the bigger defense primes" will gain from making technology to monitor drones. He names Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and RTX Corporation (RTX) (formerly Raytheon) as "well-positioned with technologies like radars" and "technologies that intercept signals." Ferguson notes that it's unlikely drone-related tech will "move the needle" for these defense companies, given they sell products like fighter jets at a $100 million price tag.

Summary: A bad October is getting worse for building-materials firms, whose shares are tumbling Tuesday thanks to rising bond yields, disappointing quarterly results from America's most prolific homebuilder and a decline in construction job openings.  The 288,000 construction job openings at the end of September was down 40,000 from August and 134,000 fewer than a year earlier.  Last month's numbers are likely skewed by hurricanes Helene and Milton, though the drop suggests a sharp decline in construction activity despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut last month.

Title: 3 investable themes, categories outside of the AI trade
Summary: While Nvidia's (NVDA) record high on Monday — the stock has since retreated in Tuesday trading — pushes the tech sector and hopes for the AI chip industry higher, perhaps there are still some opportunities for investors that lie outside of artificial intelligence. Alger Director of Market Strategy Brad Neuman sits down with the Catalysts team in-studio to talk about the three categories or investment themes he is seeing outside of AI: homebuilders, drug developers, and alternative asset managers. "Structurally, we're short homes in America... maybe 2 million homes. So there's a supply-demand imbalance," Neuman tells Seana Smith. "So it's an attractive market from that perspective. And cyclically mortgage rates are kind of elevated relative to the general interest rate picture." In the homebuilder category, Neuman names Builders FirstSource (BLDR), NVR, Inc. (NVR), and Trex Company (TREX). Neuman also makes the case for structural-cyclical dynamics in the biotech and pharmaceutical space: "The pipeline is growing, so it's a growth industry. That said there was an inventory overhang after COVID and the volumes have waned over the past couple of years. But we think they're on the upswing. And next year is setting up to be a normal year, or perhaps even better than that." He names Repligen (RGEN) and Danaher (DHR) for this category. Lastly, Neuman turns to alternative asset management firms, and lists Blue Owl Capital (OWL), StepStone Group (STEP), and Hamilton Lane (HLNE) among potential opportunities.

Title: In-play sports betting to hit $14B by decade's end: Analyst
Summary: As sports betting platforms continue to gain market share and attract more participants, Citizens JMP Senior Equity Research Analyst Jordan Bender joins to discuss why he believes in-play micro betting is poised to become a $14 billion industry. "In-play betting particularly will be a growth segment for these [sports-betting] companies," he tells Yahoo Finance, highlighting it as "an area that we think will be a major driver of revenue." Bender explains that in-play betting involves predicting a game's next move or outcome, such as a specific pitch in baseball or a pass in an NFL game, which he describes as "engagement tools." Bender estimates the total sports betting market could reach $28 billion by the end of the decade. Currently, in-play betting represents 30 to 40% of the US market, but he projects this could increase to 50 to 60% by 2030, translating to approximately $14 billion.

Title: Want to Collect a Dividend Every Month? Invest in These 3 High-Yielding Income Stocks
Summary: Collecting dividend income on a recurring basis can help strengthen your financial position and be a way for you to be less dependent on other sources of cash flow.  The one downside is that many dividend stocks only pay on a quarterly basis, which means that you'll often be waiting multiple months before the next dividend payment.  One way you can get around this is by holding at least three dividend stocks in your portfolio.

Summary: President-elect Donald Trump pledged earlier this week that he will "knock out the middlemen," in a jab against pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Major health insurers Cigna (CI), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and CVS Health (CVS) saw their stock prices drop following this statement in Tuesday's session, but appear to be recovering in Wednesday trading. "They're helping patients kind of manage through the treatment paradigm with respect to which drugs to take, which formulary drugs are on, and kind of managing that whole process. So there is a benefit they are providing," Mizuho Healthcare Equity Strategist Jared Holz tells Madison Mills and Brad Smith on the Morning Brief.&nbsp; "Within the construct of the industry, there are so many players that are making tons of money in the middle here — we have to be cognizant of that. And it's a little bit akin to what Trump said in his first term or first administration. So some consistencies here... there are definitely some truths to it," Holz says, labeling wanted healthcare reform to be a partisan effort. Holz goes on to illustrate what reform could look like under a second Trump administration, namely whether these companies will have to take on any rightsizing approaches.

First, Ados likes Applovin's (APP) EBITDA margins and is bullish on the mobile app's platform revenue growth: "It's by far the biggest in this category. And the result of it is that app developers are now able to use AI through Applovin to better market their apps, to optimize their their ad campaigns, and to specifically target the right user. That's the only company that offers that. So what's important with this? It's unlike any other AI play, this is an AI play that most people haven't realized that... it's a hidden AI play." Health insurance provider Cigna Group (CI) is Ados' goodbye stock as President-elect Donald Trump recently commented he hopes to "knock out the middleman" when it comes to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). "It's hidden through subsidiaries. So it's not that the companies itself are PBMs, but they own other companies inside them that even so, sometimes it's hard for analysts to notice the effect that this... targeting will have to the company overall," Ados explains.

Title: Commercial real estate to be 'pain point' for some banks: Strategist
Summary: The financial sector (XLF) is readying itself for an eventful 2025, with many on Wall Street expecting an uptick in dealmaking amid possible deregulations under the second Trump administration. Whalen Global Advisors Chairman Chris Whalen sits down with Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to talk more about the financial sector. Whalen Global Advisors LLC manages several indexes tracking bank stocks and the financial sector: the WGA Bank Top 10 Index (WBXSW), WGA Bank Top 25 Index (WBXXVW), WGA Bank Top 50 Index (WBLW).  "We like to focus on quality and performance. So I think for the better performers in the group, you could see more expansion, frankly. American Express (AXP) could probably flirt with six times book value next year unless we see a negative come around," Whalen tells Yahoo Finance. "But, you know, I don't see that right now. If anything, you know, we've had three quarters where the banks have moved very much."  Whalen goes on to call commercial real estate one of the "only pain point[s]" for the industry, but warning: "Banks that don't have a lot of consumer or commercial exposures are going to be fine. Banks that specialize in commercial real estate or have historically specialized in multifamily in some of the blue states, some of the larger cities are going to be taking pain."

Title: AI, power consumption, tariffs: 3 Market themes for 2025
Summary: AllianceBernstein CIO of Concentrated US Growth Jim Tierney unpacks three key market themes investors should watch in 2025 with Seana Smith and Madison Mills. The first theme is artificial intelligence, with Tierney stating, "It really has dominated the market this year, and I think it will dominate the market next year." He describes the AI trajectory as a "train ride," with semiconductors benefiting heavily in 2024. The next stop, he predicts, will be implementers, hyperscalers, and software companies in 2025, dubbing it "the year of the software company" for the AI trade. The second theme centers on power consumption. Tierney notes, "Because of efficiencies, we haven't had any growth in power consumption for decades, and we're starting to get to the point where there will be growth." He points to developments like data center expansion and reshoring, suggesting power consumption will be "an underestimated long-term driver of economic growth in the US." The third theme involves President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariff policy. Tierney highlights Constellation Brands (STZ) as a potential beneficiary of these policy shifts.

"We need more reliable power in this country; we can't do it all with wind and solar," he told Yahoo Finance, advocating for traditional energy sources like natural gas, which the Trump administration supports.

Title: Bipartisan lawmakers appear 'aligned' on PBM, insurance reform
Summary: President-elect Donald Trump pledged earlier this week that he will "knock out the middlemen," in a jab against pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Major health insurers Cigna (CI), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and CVS Health (CVS) saw their stock prices drop following this statement in Tuesday's session, but appear to be recovering in Wednesday trading. "They're helping patients kind of manage through the treatment paradigm with respect to which drugs to take, which formulary drugs are on, and kind of managing that whole process. So there is a benefit they are providing," Mizuho Healthcare Equity Strategist Jared Holz tells Madison Mills and Brad Smith on the Morning Brief.&nbsp; "Within the construct of the industry, there are so many players that are making tons of money in the middle here — we have to be cognizant of that. And it's a little bit akin to what Trump said in his first term or first administration. So some consistencies here... there are definitely some truths to it," Holz says, labeling wanted healthcare reform to be a partisan effort. Holz goes on to illustrate what reform could look like under a second Trump administration, namely whether these companies will have to take on any rightsizing approaches.

Title: Restaurants balance keeping diners and investors happy with deals
Summary: Darden Restaurants (DRI) shares gained after the Olive Garden parent company reported earnings and lifted its sales outlook. The company's results come as restaurants run promotions to appeal to value-conscious consumers, like Olive Garden's never-ending pasta deal or Chili's (EAT) and Applebee's (DIN) respective value meals. Guggenheim Securities senior analyst Gregory Francfort joins Market Domination with Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to share his outlook for the restaurant industry in 2025. "Looking back at 2024, it's been somewhat of a challenging year from a top-line perspective for restaurants, cost inflation has come down, [and] you still have labor going up," Francfort says. The analyst adds, "Food costs are much more benign than they were 12 months ago, and as we look out over the next 12 months, we expect food costs maybe ticks up a little bit [as] labor [is] kind of still sticky" and consumers spend more. He says a key challenge for restaurants right now is "having to try to balance a consumer that's pushing back a bit with also delivering a bottom line that satisfies the investor base."

Title: Why companies like Walmart are rethinking their DEI approach
Summary: Walmart's (WMT) recent decision to eliminate its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies has sparked a broader conversation about corporate social responsibility. Mills Sadat Dowlat (MSD) LLP Partner Camron Dowlatshahi joins Market Domination Overtime to share his outlook on this evolving landscape. Dowlatshahi traces the evolution of DEI initiatives following the death of George Floyd in 2020, highlighting how companies initially took "a strong stance supporting under-represented communities." However, he points out the political and social climate has shifted since then, with "the fall and the rise again of the Trump administration, conservative movement, and far-right movement in the United States, and the 'anti-woke' movements again. And because of that, you see now companies catering to those populations," pointing to businesses like Walmart and Lowe's (LOW). Despite these shifts, Dowlatshahi asserts that "discrimination is still discrimination." The attorney remains hopeful that established state and federal laws will continue to protect against workplace discrimination. Although, he acknowledges a concerning trend, telling Yahoo Finance "I have seen an increase in fear, frankly." "The hope is that we can stand on state and federal law that has been in place for decades and decades," the MSD partner concludes.

Title: Consumers are 'cautious,' but in 'good shape': Retail analyst
Summary: US retail sales data came in above economist expectations for November, rising 0.7% month-over-month. Retail Cities Managing Director Bryan Gildenberg joins Morning Brief to provide insights into the current trends in the retail sector. Gildenberg describes the consumer market as robust, with nuanced dynamics across different economic segments. He highlights that high-end retailers like Costco (COST) and RH (RH) are seeing strong performance among affluent shoppers, while discount retailers such as Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) reveal that lower-income consumers continue to be "squeezed." "I think all shoppers are being deal-sensitive; they're thoughtful and cautious about spending, but overall, consumers are in pretty good shape," he explains. However, Gildenberg adds, "I also think there's some question right now about exactly what's happening with pricing in the marketplace." He believes the potential for price normalization in the retail sector remains an "open question" heading into 2025. As for promising retail stocks, he singles out Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Urban Outfitters (URBN), calling them "probably the two best executors of store-based retail in the US."

<p>"I think all shoppers are being deal-sensitive; they're thoughtful and cautious about spending, but overall, consumers are in pretty good shape," he explains. However, Gildenberg adds, "I also think there's some question right now about exactly what's happening with pricing in the marketplace."</p>
<p>He believes the potential for price normalization in the retail sector remains an "open question" heading into 2025. As for promising retail stocks, he singles out Abercrombie & Fitch (<a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ANF">ANF</a>) and Urban Outfitters (<a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/URBN">URBN</a>), calling them "probably the two best executors of store-based retail in the US."</p>

Title: Mortgage rates creating 'tug-of-war' with affordability: Fannie Mae
Summary: The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points at their final meeting of 2024 with a majority of central bank officials now expecting to only cut rates twice in 2025. What kind of impacts could this have on mortgage rates and the US housing market? Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) chief economist Mark Palim sits down with Josh Lipton talk about more about pricing trends in the housing market. Fannie Mae's affiliate organization, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (or Freddie Mac), is scheduled to release the latest mortgage rate figures Thursday morning. "The key issue for the housing market in the United States, for sure, has been affordability, of which high mortgage rates [are] definitely part of that discussion and it's also being renter affordability," Palim says. "The Fed today came out and ratified... bond market investor concerns about whether inflation would be as stickier than it looked six months ago, or that they even looked at the beginning of the year. So you should expect mortgage rates to... remain a little higher than they might have otherwise been." Palim describes mortgage rates, a key component for the lock-in effect for homeowners, as being in a "tug-of-war" with housing affordability: "People don't want to move and give up that 3% mortgage rate and affordability. We started the year with existing home sales running at 4.2 million; we're ending the year running... around 4 million. So you're seeing the higher rates relative to where they were a few years ago really starting to affect demand."

Title: US has a 'sickcare system,' not a healthcare system: Anomaly CEO
Summary: Healthcare industry executives continue to take in Americans' reactions to the killing of UnitedHealthcare (UNH) CEO Brian Thompson, with many voicing their frustrations and outrage dealing with insurance providers and the US healthcare system at large. The suspect of last week's fatal shooting, Luigi Mangione, has been charged with Thompson's murder after being arrested in Altoona, PA on Monday. As more information comes out, NYPD investigators have already deemed the assassination to be a "pre-meditated [and] pre-planned, targeted attack." Anomaly CEO Mike Desjadon sits down in-studio with Seana Smith and Madison Mills to have a conversation about the complexities and greatest challenges Americans face in navigating the healthcare system.&nbsp; "So often in healthcare... behind the scenes, there's this whole industry figuring out what to bill and whom to bill. That part of healthcare costs a half a trillion dollars a year, and it's done wrong more than 20% of the time," Desjadon explains. "So to you, you might not get a bill, you might get a bill. And if you do, that bill might be $4 [or] it might be $84,000. And you really have no idea why or know where to turn." Oscar Health (OSCR) CEO Mark Bertolini previously told Yahoo Finance earlier this week that the healthcare system "has been broken for some time" as this tragic event has been "a wake-up call for the industry." Desjadon goes on to compare the public and private healthcare sectors and how to simplify the system for the insured.

Title: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO killing charged with murder
Summary: Luigi Mangione, the suspect in last week's fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare (UNH) CEO Brian Thompson in New York City, was arrested in Altoona, PA on Monday and has since been charged with the healthcare executive's murder. NYPD investigators believed the killing to be "a pre-meditated, pre-planned, targeted attack," but Mangione's motive has yet to be revealed. Following the assassination, Americans have been voicing their outrage and frustrations with insurance providers and broader faults in the American healthcare system. Oscar Health (OSCR) CEO Mark Bertolini told Yahoo Finance that the US healthcare system has "been broken for some time" and is "in large-part built around meeting the needs of groups" rather than individuals. Yahoo Finance senior health reporter Anjalee Khemlani details the health insurance industry's reaction to these events and whether providers are entering an inflection point as to how they handle customer claims.

Summary: Third Bridge Group Global head of analysts Peter McNally joins Market Domination Overtime to analyze FedEx's (FDX) fiscal second quarter earnings and its announcement to split into two business units. The parcel carrier and logistics operator aims to spin off its FedEx Freight segment.

He highlights FedEx Freight's strong performance within its segment but points to the company's second guidance cut in three months. Despite solid business operations, he cites headwinds including competition and a weak industrial environment "that is dragging results." McNally questions "how much more costs can be driven out of this business."

Title: Commercial real estate to be 'pain point' for some banks: Strategist
Summary: The financial sector (XLF) is readying itself for an eventful 2025, with many on Wall Street expecting an uptick in dealmaking amid possible deregulations under the second Trump administration. Whalen Global Advisors Chairman Chris Whalen sits down with Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to talk more about the financial sector. Whalen Global Advisors LLC manages several indexes tracking bank stocks and the financial sector: the WGA Bank Top 10 Index (WBXSW), WGA Bank Top 25 Index (WBXXVW), WGA Bank Top 50 Index (WBLW).  "We like to focus on quality and performance. So I think for the better performers in the group, you could see more expansion, frankly. American Express (AXP) could probably flirt with six times book value next year unless we see a negative come around," Whalen tells Yahoo Finance. "But, you know, I don't see that right now. If anything, you know, we've had three quarters where the banks have moved very much."  Whalen goes on to call commercial real estate one of the "only pain point[s]" for the industry, but warning: "Banks that don't have a lot of consumer or commercial exposures are going to be fine. Banks that specialize in commercial real estate or have historically specialized in multifamily in some of the blue states, some of the larger cities are going to be taking pain."

Title: Trump's tariffs could be 'catastrophic' for the toy industry
Summary: Tariffs have become a key policy focus ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House. Like many other industries and consumer products, toys will be hard hit by Trump's tariffs if the incoming Trump administration were to enact these trade restrictions. The Toy Book editor in chief and The Toy Insider senior editor, James Zahn, joins Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to take a closer look at how the toy industry will be affected by Trump's tariffs. Tariffs "could mean some catastrophic results for the toy industry, especially [for] small to mid-sized companies. So some of what we've heard is a 50% to 60% tariff on products coming out of China. Now we're hearing maybe it could be a little bit lower. But anything is bad when you're talking about an industry that produces roughly 80%, 85% of its goods in China." Amid geopolitical tensions between the US and China, some toymakers have shifted their production to other countries. "Funko (FNKO) is probably in the best position because they make so much in Vietnam right now, but for the rest of the majors, you've got Jakks Pacific (JAKK), Hasbro (HAS), Mattel (MAT), [and] Spin Master (TOY.TO) making so much of their product [in China]. They have diverted some of it to these other countries: Vietnam is picking up a lot [as well as] Malaysia, [and] India want in on the action." Zahn finds the biggest problem for toymakers will be capacity: "They don't have the capacity to take on the level and the volume of production that's needed. And they also don't necessarily have the expertise to get that fit and finish the way that the manufacturers need for these products."

Title: How the 10-year yield affects REITs
Summary: Interest rate-sensitive REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are set to benefit from the Federal Reserve's anticipated easing of monetary policy. Richard Anderson, Wedbush managing director of equity research for REITs, joins Catalysts to provide insights into this segment of the market. Anderson observes an "instant gratification" scenario unfolding in REITs, noting their quick recovery despite the weaker state of the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX). He explains that "any kind of investment vehicle with an income component like the REITs" tends to thrive in a declining rate environment. However, he raises questions about the longer-term outlook, wondering, "What does a better rate environment, a normal sloping yield curve, do to people's attention of the fundamentals of commercial real estate?" describing this as "the next leg of opportunity" for the sector. Anderson points out that uncertainty within the 10-year yield curve affects REITs' ability to deploy capital and grow earnings. He emphasizes, "The real thing that we're watching is the longer end of the curve. And if we get some certainty there, then it's perhaps off to the races, and perhaps we'll have an outperformance here in 2024 from the REITs." Watch the video above to hear what Anderson thinks are the most attractive investment opportunities in REITs.&nbsp; For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

Title: Bipartisan lawmakers appear 'aligned' on PBM, insurance reform
Summary: President-elect Donald Trump pledged earlier this week that he will "knock out the middlemen," in a jab against pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Major health insurers Cigna (CI), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and CVS Health (CVS) saw their stock prices drop following this statement in Tuesday's session, but appear to be recovering in Wednesday trading. "They're helping patients kind of manage through the treatment paradigm with respect to which drugs to take, which formulary drugs are on, and kind of managing that whole process. So there is a benefit they are providing," Mizuho Healthcare Equity Strategist Jared Holz tells Madison Mills and Brad Smith on the Morning Brief.&nbsp; "Within the construct of the industry, there are so many players that are making tons of money in the middle here — we have to be cognizant of that. And it's a little bit akin to what Trump said in his first term or first administration. So some consistencies here... there are definitely some truths to it," Holz says, labeling wanted healthcare reform to be a partisan effort. Holz goes on to illustrate what reform could look like under a second Trump administration, namely whether these companies will have to take on any rightsizing approaches.

Title: US has a 'sickcare system,' not a healthcare system: Anomaly CEO
Summary: Healthcare industry executives continue to take in Americans' reactions to the killing of UnitedHealthcare (UNH) CEO Brian Thompson, with many voicing their frustrations and outrage dealing with insurance providers and the US healthcare system at large. The suspect of last week's fatal shooting, Luigi Mangione, has been charged with Thompson's murder after being arrested in Altoona, PA on Monday. As more information comes out, NYPD investigators have already deemed the assassination to be a "pre-meditated [and] pre-planned, targeted attack." Anomaly CEO Mike Desjadon sits down in-studio with Seana Smith and Madison Mills to have a conversation about the complexities and greatest challenges Americans face in navigating the healthcare system.&nbsp; "So often in healthcare... behind the scenes, there's this whole industry figuring out what to bill and whom to bill. That part of healthcare costs a half a trillion dollars a year, and it's done wrong more than 20% of the time," Desjadon explains. "So to you, you might not get a bill, you might get a bill. And if you do, that bill might be $4 [or] it might be $84,000. And you really have no idea why or know where to turn." Oscar Health (OSCR) CEO Mark Bertolini previously told Yahoo Finance earlier this week that the healthcare system "has been broken for some time" as this tragic event has been "a wake-up call for the industry." Desjadon goes on to compare the public and private healthcare sectors and how to simplify the system for the insured.

Title: Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO killing charged with murder
Summary: Luigi Mangione, the suspect in last week's fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare (UNH) CEO Brian Thompson in New York City, was arrested in Altoona, PA on Monday and has since been charged with the healthcare executive's murder. NYPD investigators believed the killing to be "a pre-meditated, pre-planned, targeted attack," but Mangione's motive has yet to be revealed. Following the assassination, Americans have been voicing their outrage and frustrations with insurance providers and broader faults in the American healthcare system. Oscar Health (OSCR) CEO Mark Bertolini told Yahoo Finance that the US healthcare system has "been broken for some time" and is "in large-part built around meeting the needs of groups" rather than individuals. Yahoo Finance senior health reporter Anjalee Khemlani details the health insurance industry's reaction to these events and whether providers are entering an inflection point as to how they handle customer claims.

Title: The trade controls US could enact while navigating China chip war
Summary: United States-China semiconductor tensions are escalating as the US considers banning Chinese-made routers present in millions of American homes. Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon joins Market Domination to discuss the growing divide. Goujon highlights recent policy initiatives like the Routers Act and the US Commerce Department's ICTS (Information and Communications Technology and Services) controls, which aim to remove Chinese components from infrastructure due to increased data and cybersecurity concerns. She notes that companies like TP-Link have become deeply embedded in US infrastructure, making this a complex challenge. "What the US is doing is it's saying that 'look, there's a number of toolmakers out there that still want to feed into the Chinese chip market,'" Goujon explains. She describes a new "single chip de minimis" provision that would extend US restrictions to any factory worldwide using even one US chip. "So the US is basically telling partners 'do the right thing, align with us or else you're going to be subject to US law and compliance.'" However, Goujon cautions that the immediate impact may be limited: "The issue is that China has been able to stockpile an enormous amount of equipment, especially over the past one and a half years... and so it may take a while to even see the effects of export controls biting."

Summary: A federal regulator sued JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America on Friday, claiming the banks failed to protect hundreds of thousands of consumers from rampant fraud on the popular payments network Zelle, in violation of consumer financial laws.  In the federal civil complaint, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau asserts that the banks rushed to get the peer-to-peer payments platform to market without effective safeguards against fraud and then, after consumers complained about being defrauded on the service, largely denied them relief.  The CFPB claims that the banks violated federal consumer financial laws governing electric funds transfers, which require banks conduct “reasonable investigations” when consumers report transaction errors, and the agency's prohibition on unfair acts or practices by failing to take steps to prevent and address fraud on Zelle.

Title: Markets realize HPE 'has a right to play' in AI space: CEO Neri
Summary: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) shares closed 10% higher following the company's better-than-expected fiscal fourth quarter earnings results. HPE beat both earnings and revenue estimates, with revenue coming in at a record-high $8.46 billion, up 15% year over year (estimates were for $8.26 billion) and adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share (estimates were for $0.56 per share). HPE CEO Antonio Neri joined Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the company's earnings and the impacts of the company's initiatives to power the development of AI. "Where I was really pleased, is the fact that now enterprise is deploying AI, including ourselves," says Neri, adding "In that segment of the market, they're looking for time to value and simplicity of the offer." The CEO also discussed HPE's pending acquisition of Juniper Networks (JNPR), which is being reviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice. The company is still optimistic the deal will go through in the new year. "We have received pretty much all the approval outside the United States, with unconditional support," according to Neri, adding "We still believe the deal will close in the early part of 2025." Neri also gave his thoughts on the news of Pat Gelsinger's abrupt retirement from his role as Intel's (INTC) CEO and the importance of the chipmaker. "The United States needs a healthy Intel," says Neri. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination&nbsp;here.

Kenvue said it is trying to improve sales by spending more on marketing and supplying additional units of its skincare products to stores.  The division's sales fell 4.2% to $1.07 billion, short of the analyst consensus estimate of $1.10 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG, which Kenvue said was due to muted demand for sunscreens and related products in the reported quarter.

Title: 3 reasons bank stocks soared after Trump's reelection
Summary: Bank stocks popped after former President Donald Trump secured a second term in the White House. The financial select sector SPDR fund (XLF) rose more than 6% in intraday trading on Wednesday, with names like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) gaining. KBW managing director David Konrad joins Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to discuss why Trump's win sent the sector higher and what bank investors are looking for from his second term. Konrad says, "There's three main factors, all kind of surrounding deregulation to some extent," that sent bank stocks higher: less antitrust regulation leading to more mergers, lower capital constraints, and less pressure from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on consumer fees. "The other factor would be a little bit of the concern of the inflationary ramifications of the Trump administration, potentially, and so people are looking for more asset-sensitive names for kind of a higher for longer, and those are really the true outperformers that we saw today." Watch the video above for more about Konrad's expectations for the banking sector under Trump.

Title: Why companies like Walmart are rethinking their DEI approach
Summary: Walmart's (WMT) recent decision to eliminate its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies has sparked a broader conversation about corporate social responsibility. Mills Sadat Dowlat (MSD) LLP Partner Camron Dowlatshahi joins Market Domination Overtime to share his outlook on this evolving landscape. Dowlatshahi traces the evolution of DEI initiatives following the death of George Floyd in 2020, highlighting how companies initially took "a strong stance supporting under-represented communities." However, he points out the political and social climate has shifted since then, with "the fall and the rise again of the Trump administration, conservative movement, and far-right movement in the United States, and the 'anti-woke' movements again. And because of that, you see now companies catering to those populations," pointing to businesses like Walmart and Lowe's (LOW). Despite these shifts, Dowlatshahi asserts that "discrimination is still discrimination." The attorney remains hopeful that established state and federal laws will continue to protect against workplace discrimination. Although, he acknowledges a concerning trend, telling Yahoo Finance "I have seen an increase in fear, frankly." "The hope is that we can stand on state and federal law that has been in place for decades and decades," the MSD partner concludes.

Title: In-play sports betting to hit $14B by decade's end: Analyst
Summary: As sports betting platforms continue to gain market share and attract more participants, Citizens JMP Senior Equity Research Analyst Jordan Bender joins to discuss why he believes in-play micro betting is poised to become a $14 billion industry. "In-play betting particularly will be a growth segment for these [sports-betting] companies," he tells Yahoo Finance, highlighting it as "an area that we think will be a major driver of revenue." Bender explains that in-play betting involves predicting a game's next move or outcome, such as a specific pitch in baseball or a pass in an NFL game, which he describes as "engagement tools." Bender estimates the total sports betting market could reach $28 billion by the end of the decade. Currently, in-play betting represents 30 to 40% of the US market, but he projects this could increase to 50 to 60% by 2030, translating to approximately $14 billion.

Title: Three takeaways from Nike CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround plan
Summary: Nike (NKE) posted second quarter earnings results that exceeded Wall Street estimates, posting year-over-year declines in the sports apparel giant's revenue and profit.

Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma sits down with Morning Brief hosts Julie Hyman&nbsp;and&nbsp;Madison Mills&nbsp;to go in detail about Nike’s success seen so far under Hill's leadership, especially as he aims to invest more in the company's retailer partners like Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL) Read up on Brooke DiPalma's latest story covering Nike CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround plan for the company.

Title: Could Lockheed, Northrop, and RTX gain from US drone sightings?
Summary: Amid reports of drone sightings in the Northeastern US, the reported drones have garnered the attention of many, including President-elect Donald Trump. Bloomberg Intelligence senior aerospace defense and airlines industry analyst George Ferguson joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the reports and examine how drones could impact defense companies. "I think it's nothing sort of too far out of the ordinary," Ferguson says, noting that some drone activity, both recreational and "a bit of surveillance," is typical. As drones make headlines, investors may wonder whether the tech could benefit aerospace and defense companies. The analyst says it will likely be smaller private tech companies and "some of the bigger defense primes" will gain from making technology to monitor drones. He names Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and RTX Corporation (RTX) (formerly Raytheon) as "well-positioned with technologies like radars" and "technologies that intercept signals." Ferguson notes that it's unlikely drone-related tech will "move the needle" for these defense companies, given they sell products like fighter jets at a $100 million price tag.

Title: Turmoil at Colombia's Ecopetrol raises profit fears ahead of US investment decision
Summary: Alleged interference by Colombian President Gustavo Petro in majority state-owned Ecopetrol and purges of hundreds of staff to make way for pro-government replacements are fueling fears about the energy company's future profits and contributions to the economy.  The worries, according to interviews with workers, ex-employees, a former board member and analysts, come ahead of a March deadline for Ecopetrol to renew - or end - its joint oil venture with Occidental Petroleum in Texas.  Petro halted a separate $3.6-billion deal with Occidental to buy 30% of shale producer CrownRock in August, because of his opposition to fracking and fears about the company taking on more debt, according to two former Ecopetrol board members who resigned over the decision.

Summary: All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) rebound from a selloff fueled by the Federal Reserve's 2025 forecast coming in more hawkish than expected. Haywood Wealth Management president and co-founder Justin Haywood joins Wealth! Host Brad Smith to break down what investors should consider when positioning their portfolio. "I would call yesterday's move a hawkish cut," Haywood says, adding, "I think the Fed was probably reluctant to make this cut. They may have backed themselves into a corner in a sense with their rhetoric in September. And I think they felt like they needed to make this cut." Looking forward to 2025, he says, "the sentiment should be relatively bullish" despite uncertainty around President-elect Donald Trump's policies. "You want to ride this out," he tells Yahoo Finance. Haywood outlines his top picks, saying, "Technology remains a strong play moving into 2025." He names Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR).

Title: Industrial sector could bounce back in 2025: Goldman Sachs analyst
Summary: The industrial sector could finally rebound next year, according to a top analyst on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs Managing Director Joe Ritchie sits down with Morning Brief host Seana Smith and explains that the macroeconomic backdrop could lead to a manufacturing comeback after months of contraction. “Cautious optimism is where we’re at today,” Ritchie says at the Goldman Sachs Industrial and Materials conference this week. “Several companies are expecting better growth in 2025… It’s only a matter of time before it happens. It'll inflect at some point in 2025.” Ritchie lays out some of his top stock picks for 2025, including Parker-Hannifin (PH) and GE Vernova (GEV). On Parker-Hannifin, Ritchie says “it’s a great company and very well run… About two-thirds of the business is tied to industrial activity, and about one-third of the business is tied to aerospace and defense. They've been able to perform incredibly well even at a time when the industrial markets haven't been a tailwind for them.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here.

Title: Mortgage rates creating 'tug-of-war' with affordability: Fannie Mae
Summary: The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points at their final meeting of 2024 with a majority of central bank officials now expecting to only cut rates twice in 2025. What kind of impacts could this have on mortgage rates and the US housing market? Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) chief economist Mark Palim sits down with Josh Lipton talk about more about pricing trends in the housing market. Fannie Mae's affiliate organization, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (or Freddie Mac), is scheduled to release the latest mortgage rate figures Thursday morning. "The key issue for the housing market in the United States, for sure, has been affordability, of which high mortgage rates [are] definitely part of that discussion and it's also being renter affordability," Palim says. "The Fed today came out and ratified... bond market investor concerns about whether inflation would be as stickier than it looked six months ago, or that they even looked at the beginning of the year. So you should expect mortgage rates to... remain a little higher than they might have otherwise been." Palim describes mortgage rates, a key component for the lock-in effect for homeowners, as being in a "tug-of-war" with housing affordability: "People don't want to move and give up that 3% mortgage rate and affordability. We started the year with existing home sales running at 4.2 million; we're ending the year running... around 4 million. So you're seeing the higher rates relative to where they were a few years ago really starting to affect demand."

Title: Could Lockheed, Northrop, and RTX gain from US drone sightings?
Summary: Amid reports of drone sightings in the Northeastern US, the reported drones have garnered the attention of many, including President-elect Donald Trump. Bloomberg Intelligence senior aerospace defense and airlines industry analyst George Ferguson joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the reports and examine how drones could impact defense companies. "I think it's nothing sort of too far out of the ordinary," Ferguson says, noting that some drone activity, both recreational and "a bit of surveillance," is typical. As drones make headlines, investors may wonder whether the tech could benefit aerospace and defense companies. The analyst says it will likely be smaller private tech companies and "some of the bigger defense primes" will gain from making technology to monitor drones. He names Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and RTX Corporation (RTX) (formerly Raytheon) as "well-positioned with technologies like radars" and "technologies that intercept signals." Ferguson notes that it's unlikely drone-related tech will "move the needle" for these defense companies, given they sell products like fighter jets at a $100 million price tag.

Summary: The possibility of a government shutdown looms as Congress is unable to agree on a spending bill. Mariner Wealth Advisors chief investment strategist and head of equities Jeff Krumpelman joins Julie Hyman and Madison Mills on Morning Brief to talk about what uncertainty in Washington D.C. means for investors. "We still have, if you look longer term, a positive view, and we see further advancement in the S&P [500] (^GSPC) as we move through 2025," Krumpelman says, adding the firm 2025 year-end target for the index is 6,600. The strategist says, "I don't think any of this news flow adjusts that kind of [bullish] thinking because the fundamentals in terms of economic growth, employment data, earnings data remain pretty positive. I think this market was ready for a pause. And despite the good fundamentals, we've gotten [a] valuation that's full." "We remain positive. We know what we want to own [in the] near term. The market's saying, 'Hey man, I need a rest,' and there's some headline risk out there, whether it's Fed policy or it's news out of Washington, and people get wiggy about that." Krumpelman says tech "sports some of the strongest earnings growth amongst the S&P 500 sectors," but he cautions investors to "be very selective in what you own in semiconductors" with names like Nvidia (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). He highlights the cybersecurity space and workflow management solution providers like ServiceNow (NOW), as well as data center cloud plays.

Title: Industrial sector could bounce back in 2025: Goldman Sachs analyst
Summary: The industrial sector could finally rebound next year, according to a top analyst on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs Managing Director Joe Ritchie sits down with Morning Brief host Seana Smith and explains that the macroeconomic backdrop could lead to a manufacturing comeback after months of contraction. “Cautious optimism is where we’re at today,” Ritchie says at the Goldman Sachs Industrial and Materials conference this week. “Several companies are expecting better growth in 2025… It’s only a matter of time before it happens. It'll inflect at some point in 2025.” Ritchie lays out some of his top stock picks for 2025, including Parker-Hannifin (PH) and GE Vernova (GEV). On Parker-Hannifin, Ritchie says “it’s a great company and very well run… About two-thirds of the business is tied to industrial activity, and about one-third of the business is tied to aerospace and defense. They've been able to perform incredibly well even at a time when the industrial markets haven't been a tailwind for them.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here.

Title: There will be 'optionality' for media companies in 2025: Analyst
Summary: Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) is undergoing a restructuring, splitting its business into two distinct units: one focused on cable and linear TV, and another dedicated to streaming. This comes as a potentially more favorable environment emerges for media companies. Citi (C) Managing Director Jason Bazinet joined Market Domination to provide insights. Bazinet noted that media executives previously viewed mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as challenging under the current Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission regime. However, with Donald Trump entering the White House in January and his administration expected to implement more lenient regulatory approaches, Bazinet says this "opens up a whole degree of optionality that exists for these media companies." He elaborated on the regulatory shift, explaining, "What the Biden administration was really trying to do was to rejigger the rules such that we moved away in legal parlance from the price theory of competition —which undergirded all antitrust law in the US for the last forty or fifty years —to something that is called structuralism, which just says that big firms are bad because they're big. We're really going back to the old ways of doing things. Through that lens, everyone understands the rules of the road, and therefore that's going to open up more M&A possibilities," he told Yahoo Finance. Regarding a specific stock pick in the media sector, Bazinet highlighted Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) as a top choice as the company prepares to release "Grand Theft Auto 6."

Title: Luxury industry faces crisis: China slowdown and soaring prices
Summary: According to a Bain & Company report, 2024 was the first year of decline in luxury sales since the financial crisis in 2008. Former LVMH chair of North America Pauline Brown joined Catalysts hosts Julie Hyman&nbsp;and&nbsp;Madison Mills&nbsp;to reflect on the luxury sector’s biggest challenges in 2024 and discuss whether those losses could continue into 2025. Brown highlights the slowdown in China as a major issue, as it notably marks the end of the market's rapid growth seen in the last decade. "The issues within the sector go much deeper than China, and I think some of them are not being talked about enough," Brown says. "If you look at most of the brands ... most dramatically seen with Chanel, but also with certain items from Prada, from Dior, from&nbsp;many of the big nameplates, the price on their handbags and their shoes has gone up anywhere from 75 to 100% on the same items just in the last five years." She notes that this was "not inflation driven." Brown also points to a few standout brands, like Hermés and Ralph Lauren, that are still thriving despite these broader industry struggles.

Title: Trump's China tariffs could put Nike, Tesla at risk. Here's how.
Summary: The potential implementation of higher tariffs against China proposed by the incoming Trump administration has retail companies evaluating their operations in the region. Strategy Risks Founder and CEO Isaac Stone Fish joins Catalysts to analyze the implications for major companies, including Nike (NKE) and Tesla (TSLA). According to Fish, Nike's primary challenge centers on its regional sales performance. While the company maintains a "relatively high" supply chain presence, it faces mounting pressure from local competitors "that are trying to displace Nike" as Chinese officials aim to reduce foreign brands' dominance in its market. Fish emphasizes that "retailers and manufacturers need to make a decision about how much they're going to focus on China," citing weakening consumer demand and ongoing US-China tensions as key factors. Regarding Tesla's position in China, Fish observes that "Tesla's future in China is so tied to Trump's relationship with Musk" and how long that lasts. He highlights additional concerns about Tesla's data collection capabilities in China, noting that "there's a lot of concern that Teslas can drive into [or near] a military installation... and they're [China] a lot more paranoid about that than the Europeans or the Americans are on data protection."

Title: House Democrat says Republicans protecting Elon Musk's Chinese investments
Summary: The top Democrat on the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee said on Friday that Republicans in Congress were protecting Elon Musk's Chinese investments by scrapping provisions restricting U.S. investments.  Representative Rosa DeLauro said in a letter that Musk, the CEO of electric car maker Tesla, may have upended the government funding process to remove a provision that would regulate U.S. investments in China given his "extensive investments in China in key sectors and his personal ties with Chinese Communist Party leadership, and calls into question the real reason for Musk’s opposition to the original funding deal."

Title: The trade controls US could enact while navigating China chip war
Summary: United States-China semiconductor tensions are escalating as the US considers banning Chinese-made routers present in millions of American homes. Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon joins Market Domination to discuss the growing divide. Goujon highlights recent policy initiatives like the Routers Act and the US Commerce Department's ICTS (Information and Communications Technology and Services) controls, which aim to remove Chinese components from infrastructure due to increased data and cybersecurity concerns. She notes that companies like TP-Link have become deeply embedded in US infrastructure, making this a complex challenge. "What the US is doing is it's saying that 'look, there's a number of toolmakers out there that still want to feed into the Chinese chip market,'" Goujon explains. She describes a new "single chip de minimis" provision that would extend US restrictions to any factory worldwide using even one US chip. "So the US is basically telling partners 'do the right thing, align with us or else you're going to be subject to US law and compliance.'" However, Goujon cautions that the immediate impact may be limited: "The issue is that China has been able to stockpile an enormous amount of equipment, especially over the past one and a half years... and so it may take a while to even see the effects of export controls biting."

Title: Why companies like Walmart are rethinking their DEI approach
Summary: Walmart's (WMT) recent decision to eliminate its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies has sparked a broader conversation about corporate social responsibility. Mills Sadat Dowlat (MSD) LLP Partner Camron Dowlatshahi joins Market Domination Overtime to share his outlook on this evolving landscape. Dowlatshahi traces the evolution of DEI initiatives following the death of George Floyd in 2020, highlighting how companies initially took "a strong stance supporting under-represented communities."

Title: 3 reasons bank stocks soared after Trump's reelection
Summary: Bank stocks popped after former President Donald Trump secured a second term in the White House. The financial select sector SPDR fund (XLF) rose more than 6% in intraday trading on Wednesday, with names like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) gaining. KBW managing director David Konrad joins Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to discuss why Trump's win sent the sector higher and what bank investors are looking for from his second term. Konrad says, "There's three main factors, all kind of surrounding deregulation to some extent," that sent bank stocks higher: less antitrust regulation leading to more mergers, lower capital constraints, and less pressure from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on consumer fees. "The other factor would be a little bit of the concern of the inflationary ramifications of the Trump administration, potentially, and so people are looking for more asset-sensitive names for kind of a higher for longer, and those are really the true outperformers that we saw today." Watch the video above for more about Konrad's expectations for the banking sector under Trump.

Title: There will be 'optionality' for media companies in 2025: Analyst
Summary: Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) is undergoing a restructuring, splitting its business into two distinct units: one focused on cable and linear TV, and another dedicated to streaming. This comes as a potentially more favorable environment emerges for media companies. Citi (C) Managing Director Jason Bazinet joined Market Domination to provide insights. Bazinet noted that media executives previously viewed mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as challenging under the current Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission regime. However, with Donald Trump entering the White House in January and his administration expected to implement more lenient regulatory approaches, Bazinet says this "opens up a whole degree of optionality that exists for these media companies." He elaborated on the regulatory shift, explaining, "What the Biden administration was really trying to do was to rejigger the rules such that we moved away in legal parlance from the price theory of competition —which undergirded all antitrust law in the US for the last forty or fifty years —to something that is called structuralism, which just says that big firms are bad because they're big. We're really going back to the old ways of doing things. Through that lens, everyone understands the rules of the road, and therefore that's going to open up more M&A possibilities," he told Yahoo Finance. Regarding a specific stock pick in the media sector, Bazinet highlighted Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) as a top choice as the company prepares to release "Grand Theft Auto 6."

Summary: A federal regulator sued JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America on Friday, claiming the banks failed to protect hundreds of thousands of consumers from rampant fraud on the popular payments network Zelle, in violation of consumer financial laws.  In the federal civil complaint, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau asserts that the banks rushed to get the peer-to-peer payments platform to market without effective safeguards against fraud and then, after consumers complained about being defrauded on the service, largely denied them relief.  The CFPB claims that the banks violated federal consumer financial laws governing electric funds transfers, which require banks conduct “reasonable investigations” when consumers report transaction errors, and the agency's prohibition on unfair acts or practices by failing to take steps to prevent and address fraud on Zelle.
