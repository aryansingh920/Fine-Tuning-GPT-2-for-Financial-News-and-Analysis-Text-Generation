""Structurally, we're short homes in America... maybe 2 million homes. So there's a supply-demand imbalance,"" Neuman tells Seana Smith. ""So it's an attractive market from that perspective. And cyclically mortgage rates are kind of elevated relative to the general interest rate picture."" In the homebuilder category, Neuman names Builders FirstSource (BLDR), NVR, Inc.

That said there was an inventory overhang after COVID and the volumes have waned over the past couple of years. But we think they're on the upswing.

The first theme is artificial intelligence, with Tierney stating, ""It really has dominated the market this year, and I think it will dominate the market next year."" He describes the AI trajectory as a ""train ride,"" with semiconductors benefiting heavily in 2024. The next stop, he predicts, will be implementers, hyperscalers, and software companies in 2025, dubbing it ""the year of the software company"" for the AI trade. The second theme centers on power consumption. Tierney notes, ""Because of efficiencies, we haven't had any growth in power consumption for decades, and we're starting to get to the point where there will be growth."" He points to developments like data center expansion and reshoring, suggesting power consumption will be ""an underestimated long-term driver of economic growth in the US.""

<p>The first theme is artificial intelligence, with Tierney stating, ""It really has dominated the market this year, and I think it will dominate the market next year."" He describes the AI trajectory as a ""train ride,"" with semiconductors benefiting heavily in 2024. The next stop, he predicts, will be implementers, hyperscalers, and software companies in 2025, dubbing it ""the year of the software company"" for the AI trade.</p>
<p>The second theme centers on power consumption. Tierney notes, ""Because of efficiencies, we haven't had any growth in power consumption for decades, and we're starting to get to the point where there will be growth."" He points to developments like data center expansion and reshoring, suggesting power consumption will be ""an underestimated long-term driver of economic growth in the US.""</p>
<p>The third theme involves President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariff policy. Tierney highlights Constellation Brands (<a data-i13n=""cpos:3;pos:1"" href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/STZ"">STZ</a>) as a potential beneficiary of these policy shifts.</p>

DE,Why companies like Walmart are rethinking their DEI approach,"Walmart's (WMT) recent decision to eliminate its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies has sparked a broader conversation about corporate social responsibility. Mills Sadat Dowlat (MSD) LLP Partner Camron Dowlatshahi joins Market Domination Overtime to share his outlook on this evolving landscape. Dowlatshahi traces the evolution of DEI initiatives following the death of George Floyd in 2020, highlighting how companies initially took ""a strong stance supporting under-represented communities."" However, he points out the political and social climate has shifted since then, with ""the fall and the rise again of the Trump administration, conservative movement, and far-right movement in the United States, and the 'anti-woke' movements again. And because of that, you see now companies catering to those populations,"" pointing to businesses like Walmart and Lowe's (LOW). Despite these shifts, Dowlatshahi asserts that ""discrimination is still discrimination."" The attorney remains hopeful that established state and federal laws will continue to protect against workplace discrimination. Although, he acknowledges a concerning trend, telling Yahoo Finance ""I have seen an increase in fear, frankly.""

HAS,Trump's tariffs could be 'catastrophic' for the toy industry,"Tariffs have become a key policy focus ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House. Like many other industries and consumer products, toys will be hard hit by Trump's tariffs if the incoming Trump administration were to enact these trade restrictions. The Toy Book editor in chief and The Toy Insider senior editor, James Zahn, joins Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to take a closer look at how the toy industry will be affected by Trump's tariffs. Tariffs ""could mean some catastrophic results for the toy industry, especially [for] small to mid-sized companies. So some of what we've heard is a 50% to 60% tariff on products coming out of China. Now we're hearing maybe it could be a little bit lower. But anything is bad when you're talking about an industry that produces roughly 80%, 85% of its goods in China."" Amid geopolitical tensions between the US and China, some toymakers have shifted their production to other countries. ""Funko (FNKO) is probably in the best position because they make so much in Vietnam right now, but for the rest of the majors, you've got Jakks Pacific (JAKK), Hasbro (HAS), Mattel (MAT), [and] Spin Master (TOY.TO) making so much of their product [in China]. They have diverted some of it to these other countries: Vietnam is picking up a lot [as well as] Malaysia, [and] India want in on the action."" Zahn finds the biggest problem for toymakers will be capacity: ""They don't have the capacity to take on the level and the volume of production that's needed.

DOC,How the 10-year yield affects REITs,"Interest rate-sensitive REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are set to benefit from the Federal Reserve's anticipated easing of monetary policy. Richard Anderson, Wedbush managing director of equity research for REITs, joins Catalysts to provide insights into this segment of the market. Anderson observes an ""instant gratification"" scenario unfolding in REITs, noting their quick recovery despite the weaker state of the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX). He explains that ""any kind of investment vehicle with an income component like the REITs"" tends to thrive in a declining rate environment. However, he raises questions about the longer-term outlook, wondering, ""What does a better rate environment, a normal sloping yield curve, do to people's attention of the fundamentals of commercial real estate?"" describing this as ""the next leg of opportunity"" for the sector. Anderson points out that uncertainty within the 10-year yield curve affects REITs' ability to deploy capital and grow earnings. He emphasizes, ""The real thing that we're watching is the longer end of the curve. And if we get some certainty there, then it's perhaps off to the races, and perhaps we'll have an outperformance here in 2024 from the REITs.""

<p>Anderson observes an ""instant gratification"" scenario unfolding in REITs, noting their quick recovery despite the weaker state of the 10-year Treasury yield (<a data-i13n=""cpos:1;pos:1"" href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX/"">^TNX</a>). He explains that ""any kind of investment vehicle with an income component like the REITs"" tends to thrive in a declining rate environment. However, he raises questions about the longer-term outlook, wondering, ""What does a better rate environment, a normal sloping yield curve, do to people's attention of the fundamentals of commercial real estate?"" describing this as ""the next leg of opportunity"" for the sector.</p>
<p>Anderson points out that uncertainty within the 10-year yield curve affects REITs' ability to deploy capital and grow earnings. He emphasizes, ""The real thing that we're watching is the longer end of the curve. And if we get some certainty there, then it's perhaps off to the races, and perhaps we'll have an outperformance here in 2024 from the REITs.""</p>
<p>Watch the video above to hear what Anderson thinks are the most attractive investment opportunities in REITs. </p>

NKE,Why Nike’s NFL contract extension is good for sportswear brand,"It was announced this week that Nike (NKE) will be extending their contract with the NFL through 2038 to continue exclusively providing all teams in the league their uniforms, sideline gear, and additional apparel. This is great news for the NFL as well as the sportswear brand. This week on Yahoo Finance Sports Report, host Joe Pompliano gets into detail about the contract extension, brand collaboration, and what it could mean for Nike’s future. In addition to providing the aforementioned attire for the team, “Nike made it known that they’re also going to be supporting a variety of the NFL’s developmental initiatives, including high school football, college football, and also flag football,” says Pompliano.
